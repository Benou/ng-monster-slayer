Aye Heroes ! Are you ready for the great battle ?! Maybe you are afraid to fight against monsters...
Be brave ! Be strong ! This is the Monster Slayer App !

You can make `attacks`, `heal` yourself, sometimes a `special attack` is available and finally if the
fear is too intense, you can `surrender` !
